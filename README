# Flood Prediction using Satellite Image Segmentation 🌊🛰️

This project focuses on **predicting water floods from satellite imagery** using **image segmentation techniques**.  
By applying deep learning models, the system is able to identify and separate flooded regions from non-flooded areas in satellite images.

## Goals
- Detect flood-affected regions from satellite data.  
- Apply image segmentation to generate masks highlighting water vs. land.  
- Provide insights that can help in disaster management and planning.  

## Methods
- Preprocessing satellite images.  
- Training and evaluating segmentation models (e.g., U-Net, CNN-based approaches).  
- Visualizing predictions with overlayed masks.  

## Future Work
- Improve accuracy with larger datasets.  
- Explore real-time flood prediction.  
- Integrate with GIS platforms for decision support.
